# Renewable Energy Impacts in Norway (R / Quarto)

## Overview
This project analyses renewable electricity generation trends in Norway compared to European countries and evaluates the statistical relationship between renewable electricity production and CO2 emissions (1990–2025).

## Research Questions
- Is Norway a leader in renewable electricity generation compared to Europe?
- To what extent does renewable electricity generation correlate with CO2 emissions?

## Methodology
- Time-series filtering (1990–2025)
- Cross-country renewable comparison
- Linear regression modelling (CO2 ~ Renewable TWh)
- Visual trend analysis

## Key Result
Linear regression results indicate no statistically significant relationship between renewable electricity generation and CO2 reduction (p-value > 0.05).
