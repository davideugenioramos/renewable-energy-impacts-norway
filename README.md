# Renewable Energy Impacts in Norway (R / Quarto)

## Overview
This project analyses renewable electricity generation trends in Norway compared to European countries and evaluates the statistical relationship between renewable electricity production and CO2 emissions (1990–2025).

## Research Questions
1. Is Norway a leader in renewable electricity generation compared to Europe?
2. To what extent does renewable electricity generation correlate with changes in CO2 emissions?

## Methodology
- Data filtering (1990–2025)
- Comparative time-series analysis
- Cross-country renewable comparison
- Linear regression model (CO2 vs Renewable TWh)

## Statistical Model
Linear model:  
CO2 ~ Renewable Electricity (TWh)

Results indicate no statistically significant relationship (p-value > 0.05).

## Tools & Technologies
